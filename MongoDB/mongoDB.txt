       Its important for the database to be able to run anywhere Any basic application in the business world has two parts the part that the users connect to through their front end application and then those applications are linked to API calls that connect to the database. Atlas was made to reduce the plumbing needed in most apps used nowadays. A realm database is a super useful for a serverless experience. Needing to update people who work on the ocean for instance need updates to happen in real time. They built an app in Atlas just for them since it can run without needing an online connection. The code needed to write the offline sync is only 3 lines of code. Its also possible to sync data across platforms. Realm is powerful, it can allow you to resync with data when you come back online. It can create a graphical interface to interact with the database very easily. Atlas search is a useful way to finding data inside your mongoDB. There are lots of features here to easily find what piece of data you want. It allows for search indexes too on each item.
       Charts make it easy to visualize and find data within your database. You can easily embed the link for the chart within your html code. Union allows you to combine different data from different pipelines. It allows you to push much more work to the database without slowing it down. Atlas Archive allows you archive data in your clusters very easily. MongoDB will automatically archive your data.
